# RISC-V Instruction Encoder/Decoder for VSCode

Instantly encode RISC-V assembly instructions and decode hexadecimal machine code right in your editor! Perfect for RISC-V development, education, debugging, or anyone working with RISC-V instructions.

## Features

### ‚ö° Quick Command
Select text and right-click (or use command palette) to show instruction details:
- For hex values: Shows the decoded assembly instruction
- For assembly: Shows the encoded hex value
Results appear in the output panel with detailed information.

Hover over hex values to see assembly instruction, format, and ISA details. Supports standard hex and SystemVerilog formats.
Enable via `rvcodec-js.enableHover`.

## Settings

- `rvcodec-js.enableInlineDecoding`: Enable/disable inline assembly decoding (default: false)
- `rvcodec-js.enableHover`: Enable/disable instruction decoding on hover (default: false)
- `rvcodec-js.useAbiNames`: Use ABI names (a0, sp) instead of numeric (x10, x2) (default: false)
